# ADVANCED-DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECT

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of laptops based on various features such as processor, RAM, storage, and display. By analyzing a dataset of laptop specifications and prices, the model learns the underlying patterns and relationships between these features and the target price.

Key Steps

1.Data Collection and Preprocessing: The first step involves gathering a dataset of laptop specifications and prices. This data needs to be cleaned, formatted, and prepared for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is analyzed to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target price. This step helps identify important variables and potential challenges in the data.

3. Feature Engineering: Based on the insights from the EDA, new features may be created or existing ones transformed to improve the model’s performance.

4. Model Selection and Training: Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated, such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests. The best-performing model is selected and trained on the prepared dataset.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is tested on a held-out validation set to assess its performance metrics, such as mean squared error or R-squared.

6. Model Building: Algorithms used-

i.Linear Regression: A simple algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent variable (price) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear equation. It’s useful for understanding how the target variable changes with each feature.

ii.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm used for both classification and regression. For predicting laptop prices, KNN identifies the k most similar instances (neighbors) in the dataset and predicts the price based on the average price of these neighbors.

iii.Decision Trees: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on the most significant features, creating a tree structure of decisions. Each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf represents the predicted outcome.

iv.XGBoost: An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework. It combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

v.Stacking Algorithm: An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models (base learners) to improve prediction accuracy. It uses another model (meta-learner) to learn how to best combine the predictions from the base learners.

We used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate the performance of these models. The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with the lowest error metrics and highest R-squared value.

Key Findings

The most important features for predicting laptop prices are processor speed, RAM, and storage capacity.
Laptops with higher-end processors and more RAM tend to be more expensive, all else being equal.
The model achieves an R-squared score of 0.85 on the validation set, indicating that it can explain 85% of the variance in laptop prices.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to predict laptop prices based on their specifications. The trained model can be used by consumers to estimate the cost of laptops or by manufacturers to optimize their pricing strategies. Future work could involve collecting a larger and more diverse dataset, exploring additional features, or experimenting with more advanced machine learning algorithms.
